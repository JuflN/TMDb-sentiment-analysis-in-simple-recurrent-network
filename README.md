# TMDb-sentiment-analysis-in-simple-recurrent-network
We aim to train a Simple Recurrent Network (SRN) using data from TMDb for sentiment analysis as part of a scientific initiation project at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC). The goal is to apply formal verification techniques to analyze the properties of this type of neural network.
